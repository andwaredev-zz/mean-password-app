# mean-password-app
Foundation for a MEAN user-based web app. Features passport, bcrypt, mongoose, and sendgrid (for forgotten password reset, although it would be quite simple to replace send grid with another mail service).

# Getting Started
First install MongoDB. Open a terminal tab and issue the command <br />
`mongod`<br /> 
to start running a mongo instance locally.<br />
Next, clone the git repo to your disk, cd into it, and issue <br />
`npm install && npm start`<br />
This should get you up and running on localhost:3000!<br />
Now build up.
